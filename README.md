# credit-risk-classification

In this Challenge, various techniques have been used to train and evaluate a supervised machine learning model based on loan risk. A dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company was used to build the model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

A report is also included to evaluate the models created which helps determine if they are ready to be implemented in the real world. 

Repository structure:
- The lending_data.csv used to train and test the machine learning model is stored within: Credit_Risk > Resources directory. 
- The supervised machine learning algorithm is stored within the Credit_Risk directory.
- The report which evaluates the logistic regression models is stored within main credit-risk-classification repository page.
