# credit-risk-classification

In this Challenge, various techniques have been used to train and evaluate a supervised machine learning model based on loan risk. A dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company was used to build the model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

A report is also included to evaluate the models created which helps determine if they are ready to be implemented in the real world.
